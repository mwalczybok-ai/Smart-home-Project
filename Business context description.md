SmartiHome - Business Context & Vision

1. Project Vision

To create a seamless, centralized, and intelligent home automation experience that empowers users to manage their living environment effortlessly, enhancing comfort, security, and energy efficiency through a single, intuitive platform.

2. Problem Statement

In the current market, home automation is often fragmented. A user might have one app for their smart lights, another for their thermostat, and a third for their security system. This "app clutter" leads to a disjointed and frustrating user experience.

Furthermore, users lack a simple, at-a-glance way to get essential information (like weather or indoor temperature) without searching for their phone.

'SmartiHome' aims to solve this by unifying device control and essential information into one simple, reliable, and accessible ecosystem (via a mobile app and an optional central hub device).

3. Target Audience & User Personas

The Busy Professional (Persona: "Alex, 34")

Needs: Efficiency, remote control, and "set it and forget it" automation.

Pain Point: Forgetting to turn off lights or adjust the thermostat; wants the home to be ready when they arrive.

Key Driver: Convenience.

The Security-Conscious Family (Persona: "The Lees")

Needs: Peace of mind, remote monitoring, and instant alerts.

Pain Point: Worrying about home security while at work or on vacation.

Key Driver: Security.

The Energy-Conscious Homeowner (Persona: "Maria, 52")

Needs: To reduce utility bills and lower their environmental impact.

Key Driver: Efficiency & Cost Savings.

The Tech-Savvy "Early Adopter" (Persona: "Sam, 28")

Needs: To connect and tinker with all their different smart devices.

Pain Point: Devices from different brands not working together.

Key Driver: Connectivity & Customization.

4. Key Features (Epics)

Epic 1: Centralized Device Control: Unify control of all compatible "secondary" smart devices (lights, plugs, locks) in one interface.

Epic 2: Climate & Environment Management: Integrate with smart thermostats and environmental sensors (indoor/outdoor) for full climate control.

Epic 3: Home Security & Monitoring: Provide a dashboard for security devices (sensors, locks, cameras) and manage alerts.

Epic 4: Automation & Routines: Allow users to create "Scenes" and "Routines" that trigger multiple actions based on time, location, or sensor data.

Epic 5: Information Hub Dashboard: A clear, simple dashboard (on the app and physical device) displaying key information like weather, time, and device status.

5. Expanded Use Cases

Use Case 1 (Control): A user is in bed and uses the 'SmartiHome' app to turn off all connected lights in the house with a single "Good Night" button.

Use Case 2 (Climate): A user is on their way home from work. They open the app, see the internal temperature is 18°C, and set the thermostat to 22°C, so the house is warm when they arrive.

Use Case 3 (Security): While on vacation, a user receives a push notification "Front Door Sensor Triggered." They open the app to check the event log and (in a future version) view the camera feed.

Use Case 4 (Automation): A user creates a "Welcome Home" routine. When their phone connects to the home Wi-Fi (or based on GPS location), the hallway lights turn on, and the thermostat adjusts to their preferred "home" setting.

Use Case 5 (Information): A user is getting ready for work and glances at the 'SmartiHome' physical hub device on their counter to see the current time, outdoor temperature, and a "rain expected" icon.
